//! RTC spec step 1: is the critical path *building* the workbook or *recomputing* it?
//!
//! Not run by default. Invoke explicitly:
//!
//!   cargo test -p visigrid-engine --release --test rtc_phase_bench -- --ignored --nocapture
//!
//! Why this exists, from planning/visigrid/realtime-collaboration-architecture.md:
//! the WASM boundary is stateless, so `recompute(input)` reconstructs the whole
//! workbook from scratch on every call. Two different native-lane projects
//! could fix the per-keystroke cost — (A) hold a resident workbook across the
//! boundary, (B) recalculate incrementally inside the engine — and a figure
//! that times the exported `recompute` end to end cannot tell them apart. The
//! browser-measurement note says so outright: the wasm API does construct +
//! dep_graph + recompute in ONE call, so a browser figure never maps to a
//! single phase, and separating them from outside by varying the
//! literal-to-formula mix rests on construction scaling with cell count, which
//! is false.
//!
//! So the separation has to happen where the phases are: here, in-process,
//! against the same engine calls `build_workbook` makes.
//!
//! ## Method
//!
//! The measurement note's rule is that absolute milliseconds are meaningful
//! for the machine and the minute they were taken on and nothing else — a
//! figure captured one day cannot legitimately be compared against one
//! captured the next, and best-of-N tightens the estimate of a contaminated
//! state rather than escaping it.
//!
//! Its answer there was to interleave the things being compared in one run.
//! That cannot be done literally here: these phases are ordered by dependency,
//! and recompute cannot run before the writes that give it something to
//! recompute. So the discipline is applied one level up:
//!
//!   - every phase is timed inside the SAME round, on the same workbook;
//!   - the decision quantity is the per-round RATIO recompute/build, and the
//!     reported figure is the median of those ratios — drift that dirties a
//!     round inflates numerator and denominator together and cancels;
//!   - fixtures are visited in a rotating order across rounds, so no size
//!     systematically inherits a bigger one's heap;
//!   - a discarded warm-up round precedes the timed ones.
//!
//! Absolute medians are printed too, because "which dominates" is not the only
//! question — 3 ms and 300 ms mean different things for a keystroke — but they
//! are machine-and-minute figures and are labelled as such.

// =============================================================================
// Follow-on: what a resident workbook would actually pay per keystroke.
//
// The first test measures the phases of today's stateless call. It answers
// "which phase dominates" but not "is a resident workbook enough", because
// under a resident workbook a keystroke would not call recompute_full_ordered
// at all — it would go through the tracked-write path the desktop app already
// uses: set_cell_value_tracked -> note_cell_changed -> recalc_dirty_set, which
// BFSes the dirty subgraph and evaluates only that.
//
// So this times exactly that call, on an already-built workbook, and compares
// it against the full recompute of the same fixture.
//
// The case that matters most is the narrow one, and it is what this harness
// was written to catch. `recalc_dirty_set` used to call
// `topo_order_all_formulas()` — a full topological sort of EVERY formula in
// the workbook — on every edit, however small the change, which cost 78 ms for
// a ONE-dependent edit on 200k formulas. It now orders only the dirty subgraph
// (`dep_graph::topo_order_subset`), and the same edit is ~0.002 ms and flat
// across sizes. A one-dependent edit is the measurement that keeps it honest:
// the dirty set is 1, so anything the edit costs beyond trivial is ordering
// work that should not be happening.
//
// (An edit with NO dependents cannot isolate it — `recalc_dirty_set` returns
// early on an empty dirty set, before the sort.)
